# Example sites to look at:
# 1. https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/docs/ - this folder contains all of the actual
#    Jekyll website files for this website here: https://jekyllrb.com/.
# 2. https://github.com/jekyll/minima
# 3. https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/devlopr/ - very nice-looking, with a really cool auto-typing
#    text string at the top, and a nice light/dark mode button too.
#   1. GitHub: https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll
#   2. Live demo: https://devlopr.netlify.app/
# 4. https://jekyllcodex.org/
#   1. GitHub: https://github.com/jhvanderschee/jekyllcodex
# 5. Example containing "categories" too:
#   1. See PlanetJekyll plugins repo:
#      https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-plugins#tags--taggings-categories--categorizations
#   2. Another example by CodinFox:
#     1. https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/
#     2. live demo of Categories: http://codinfox.github.io/blog/categories/
#     3. live demo of Tags: http://codinfox.github.io/blog/tags/

# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
