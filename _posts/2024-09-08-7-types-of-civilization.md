In theoretical physics, according to the [Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale), there are 7 Types of civilization. Earth is level 0.7. 

I view the electric car as a step towards level 1.0. It moves towards a system that can harness energy from non-burnable resources. It also enables interplanetary travel. The cost of moving gasoline or burnable fuels to Mars, for instance, is prohibitive. Using electric vehicles allows us to transport vehicles to Mars that can be "fueled" using energy available on Mars; namely: solar power. Electric cars can also utilize nuclear power. They are a clear and unavoidable step towards society's advancement to eventually becoming a Type 1.0 civilization. 

Here's the video, at the time where Level 0 is introduced:

You might say that God himself is part of a level 7 civilization. 

When people (typically right-wing conservatives, in my self-acknowledged-_biased_ observation) grab onto their level 0 technology with a death grip and condemn level 1 technology as Level 1 technology is introduced, parts of me feel really angry. So, I get with those emotions and feel and process them. I consider such people to have blinders on and I just want to shake them and say,

> **Wake up! Don't you know you are blocking humanity's progression towards becoming a Level 1 civilization!!!??? Your perspective is so limiting and blind!**

To demonstrate my belief: as of a couple months ago: I now own a Tesla Model Y, and have invested $10k in Tesla and $10k into a solar-powered electric car company called [Aptera](https://aptera.us/), with a 2-seat car that has a range up to 1000 miles. So, this is stuff I believe in with my money, not just my mind. In the next 20 years, I may be able to increase my investment in Tesla into the millions of dollars--which I expect to mostly be achieved by growth, not deposits. 

So, hopefully this video illuminates your understanding, taking into account any religious beliefs you may hold as well which resonate with what you see here. 

Another interesting perspective I hold which resonates with me is that aging and natural death is an automatic, built-in, natural and critical part of societal growth in order to allow civilizations to progress. As older generations who death-grip their old technology pass away, so does society's resistance to progress.

These are perspectives to consider, and which resonate with me. Again, with some modifications to how it is presented here, my simultaneously-held both scientific and religious belief is that God himself is, or is part of, a Level 7 civilization.

If you watch the video, it his highly likely your perspectives will be widened. 

Sincerely,

Gabriel Staples
