# The [Setpower AB15 mini-fridge/freezer](https://amzn.to/4fr717k) for < $200 on Amazon is _the perfect fridge for the Tesla Model Y_

Get the fridge here: <https://amzn.to/4fr717k>.

[Get $1000 off the purchase of a new Tesla here](https://ts.la/gabriel236516). I love my Tesla Model Y, and have lifted it even so I can take it off-roading to remote camping sites only trucks can normally get to. 

The Setpower AB15 mini-fridge/freezer fits perfectly in nearly every place you can think of in the 7-seater Tesla Model Y, including:
1. In the frunk
    1. ...including pushed against the far left or far right sides so long as the back (high side) of the fridge is near the center of the frunk.
1. In the rear sub-floor trunk. 
1. In the front passenger seat footwell.
1. In the rear passenger seat footwells. 
1. On the front center console between the two front seats. 
1. On the rear middle seat when the middle seat only is down. 
1. Behind the 3rd row seats when in 7-seater mode. 
    1. ...including when shoved against the far left or far right sides so long as the back (high side) of the fridge is near the center of the car.
1. Stacked two-fridges-wide in 6-seater mode with one of the 3rd row seats down.


## What it holds

The fridge/freezer can hold all of this at once, for example:

1. 1 gallon of milk
1. Either:
    1. This:
        1. 64 oz (half gallon) bottle
        1. and 28 oz Powerade bottle
    1. OR this:
        1. 1 large plastic tupperware container
1. 32 oz (1 quart) paper carton (chocolate milk shown below)
1. 2 or 3 x 8 oz packs of sliced cheese (only 1 shown in the photos)
1. 32 oz (2 lb) bag of shredded cheese, partially used but still mostly full
1. half loaf of bread

Photos of food in the fridge just now. And yes, it closes in all of these configurations:

## Where the [Setpower AB15 mini-fridge/freezer](https://amzn.to/4fr717k) fits in the Tesla Model Y

See the photos here. This fridge literally fits perfectly, as though it was custom made and custom-fit for the Tesla Model Y 5 and 7-seaters. If it was even a few mm longer in any dimension, it wouldn't fit in many of these places.

Yes, the sub-trunk cover closes just fine with the fridge in the sub-trunk, without making contact with the fridge:

Yes, the frunk closes just fine so long as you keep the curved part of the fridge towards the left or right edges, and the high rear part of the fridge near the center of the frunk:

Note: the AB16 black fridge here blocks the door from closing on the far right because the corner sticks out too much. The corners of the blue AB15 are a bit more rounded. If it was two AB15s here instead, they would fit just barely and the trunk door would still close:

Again, get the Setpower AB15 mini-fridge/freezer here: <https://amzn.to/4fr717k>. I just got one for camping and road trips and it's perfect. It holds a gallon of milk just fine too.
