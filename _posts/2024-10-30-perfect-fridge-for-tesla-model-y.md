# The [Setpower AB15 mini-fridge](https://amzn.to/4fr717k) for < $200 on Amazon is _the perfect fridge for the Tesla Model Y_

Get it here: https://amzn.to/4fr717k

It fits perfectly in nearly every place you can think of in the 7-seater Tesla Model Y, including:
1. In the frunk
    1. ...including pushed against the far left or far right sides so long as the back (high side) of the fridge is near the center of the frunk.
1. In the rear sub-floor trunk. 
1. In the front passenger seat footwell.
1. In the rear passenger seat footwells. 
1. On the front center console between the two front seats. 
1. On the rear middle seat when the middle seat only is down. 
1. Behind the 3rd row seats when in 7-seater mode. 
    1. ...including when shoved against the far left or far right sides so long as the back (high side) of the fridge is near the center of the car.
1. Stacked two-fridges-wide in 6-seater mode with one of the 3rd row seats down.

See the photos here. This fridge literally fits perfectly, as though it was custom made and custom-fit for the Tesla Model Y 5 and 7-seaters. If it was even a few mm longer in any dimension, it wouldn't fit in many of these places.

Note: the AB16 black fridge here blocks the door from closing on the far right because the corner sticks out too much. The corners of the blue AB15 are a bit more rounded. If it was two AB15s here instead, they would fit just barely and the trunk door would still close:

Again, get the AB15 here: https://amzn.to/4fr717k. I just got one for camping and road trips and it's perfect. It holds a gallon of milk just fine too.
