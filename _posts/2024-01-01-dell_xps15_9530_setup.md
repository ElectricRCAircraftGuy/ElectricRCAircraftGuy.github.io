I just bought the brand new top-of-the-line [Dell XPS 15 9530 laptop](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-15-laptop/spd/xps-15-9530-laptop) with all of the upgrades. I got the non-touchscreen, however, because it has a less-reflective, matte finish instead of glossy, and it has a higher brightness (500 nits vs 400 nits). 

To get the best value on RAM and SSD, I'm upgrading them myself. I'll dual-boot Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. 

This article it intended as notes to myself, and to others with some technical experience. For brand-new beginners, please post questions in the comments below, or do some additional googling or talking to AIs for help. And I'll try to reply to your comments. 

This article is a work-in-progress. I'll update it as I go, and check steps off as I complete them.

        1. [ ] when you buy the laptop from Dell, **add a note to the order requesting that they install the second (right) SSD thermal plate and screw**, or else it won't come with one. If it doesn't come with one, you can either fight with them over support and possibly get it for as little as $1.99 with free shipping, or just buy it yourself on Amazon. Do both. Return the Amazon one if the Dell one comes in time. Or, to save hassle, just keep the Amazon one and be done!
