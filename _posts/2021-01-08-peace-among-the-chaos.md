> I was in a small airplane and all of the sudden the engine on the wing caught fire. It exploded and burning oil was poured all over the right side of the airplane and we started to dive toward the Earth. We were spinning down to our death...and I was calm.

-Elder Russell M. Nelson (now President of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/)), 18 Nov. 2011
