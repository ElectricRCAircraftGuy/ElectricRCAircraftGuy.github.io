Here are my two articles on this topic so far: 
1. [ElectricRCAircraftGuy.com: Propeller Static & Dynamic Thrust Calculation - Part 1 of 2](https://www.electricrcaircraftguy.com/2013/09/propeller-static-dynamic-thrust-equation.html)
1. [ElectricRCAircraftGuyc.com: Propeller Static & Dynamic Thrust Calculation - Part 2 of 2 - How Did I Come Up With This Equation?](https://www.electricrcaircraftguy.com/2014/04/propeller-static-dynamic-thrust-equation-background.html)

If you have questions or comments about those articles, feel free to leave them in the comments here. Leaving comments under those articles is very limited, so leaving comments here is better. 

You'll need to create a GitHub account to leave a comment here, but again, it's worth it. Here are some of the advantages of leaving comments here: 
1. After leaving a comment, you can edit or delete it. 
1. You can [write in Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) here, which is powerful and efficient.
1. You can optionally write your comment using the [GitHub Issues GUI comment editor here](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/ElectricRCAircraftGuy.github.io/issues/53).
1. You can insert images, code, quotes, bold, italics, headings, etc., and possibly even MathJax equations (I haven't tried that yet) here.
