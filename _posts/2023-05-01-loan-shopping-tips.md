1. As you shop lenders, compare against the official mortgage rates here: <https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms>.
    1. Loan officers expect you to not know this website exists...but it does. Example screenshot:

1. A really good lender will be equal to or up to a 1/4 point<sup>1</sup> _lower_ than the rates on the chart above, with *no* buy-down points and *no origination fees*. 

    _<sup>Note 1</sup> A "point" is 1% of the original loan amount, so 1/4 point = 0.25% of the original loan amount._

1. If you are VA-loan eligible (as a prior US military member / a US military veteran), using your VA loan can drop your interest rate an additional 1/4 to 1/2 point belwo that it would otherwise be, for free, since VA loans are lower interest. VA loans can also allow _$0 down payments_ in many cases if that's something that interests you. 
    1. Here is my VA loan calculator: <https://gabrielstaples.com/va-loan-calculator/>. 
    1. In my experience, probably 80% of loan officers won't know how to do these calculations for you, so you have to do them yourself. They will rely on their loan originators to do the calculations, which can stall you for weeks potentially and may require you to proceed with the loan first.

1. Using a loan *broker*, not an originator nor consumer-facing lender, can frequently give you better deals. 
    1. Ex: a broker might get your a loan through PennyMac at 6.00% interest with zero buy-down points and $0 lender origination fees, whereas if you went to PennyMac directly, they might get you only 6.25% interest rate with zero buy-down points and $1500 lender origination fees. When you go to the consumer-facing loan department at PennyMac, you are costing them more overhead money, paying that loan officer to talk to you. By going to the broker instead, they save their overhead costs, and the broker is incentivized to try harder to reduce their own costs so they can take a lower cut and still make money when they sell your loan to PennyMac in the "wholesale debt market" behind the scenes. 
    1. Loan brokers essentially buy and sell debt to and from loan originators in a wholesale "debt market", which is like the stock market, but used to buy and sell _debt_ instead of _equity_. 
    1. Why would someone want to buy your debt, you might ask? Well, lenders might want to "buy your debt" by taking on your loan so that they can collect your interest payments. If you have a high credit score and are a low risk, they can pay $1M for your $900k loan, for instance, to buy it from another lender or to originate it, but then they might collect $1.9425M (assuming 6% interest rate) over the life of the loan, making money over the next 30 years. 

1. To calculate the cost of your mortgage over X years, use my spreadsheet here: [My Personal Finances - Staples - Just the TVM (Time Value of Money) Equations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GZvHTyyKIuV4SGgt61tPM33Cy5MuaomVhI0mXjECIS4/edit?usp=sharing), equation 6. 
    1. Example, enter a loan amount of **$900000**, **6.00%** annual interest, **30 years**, **12 compounding periods per year**, and you'll see that the loan will cost you **$5395.95/month** for principal and interest payments, for a total lifetime payment of **$1942543.70**, with **$1042543.70** of that being interest!

1. NEVER give your SSN nor birthday nor other highly-guarded personally identifying information to a loan officer on the phone until they have emailed you and you have verified their true _from_ email address to ensure it looks like it comes from a valid company, _and_ their registered NMLS number here: <https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/>.

1. If a lender's verbal numbers over the phone are competitive, always ask for an "LE" (Loan Estimate) when shopping for a new mortgage loan through brokers or lenders. It is a concise 3\~4-page document that lays out the basics of what they can offer you. 
    1. When comparing LEs, remove the "Prepaids" (section F) and the "Initial Escrow Payment at Closing" (section G) sections from your comparisons across multiple LEs / multiple lenders. Some lenders do a really good job getting these parts right, but most gloss over them initially and leave them blank or just guess some numbers for the first draft. In the end, property taxes are determined by the _county_, not the lender, and homeowner's insurance is determined by _you_ and your home insurance company, not the lender!. Also, section F varies based on the _exact closing day_ you end up signing the loan on, so this can easily vary from estimate to estimate even if the estimates are otherwise equal, and the lender won't actually take the time to contact the county and get Section G totally right until you have fully applied and are on your way towards closing on the loan. 
    1. So, remove those sections when comparing across LEs. 
    1. Note: the **"Loan Estimate" (LE)** replaces the older **"Good Faith Estimate" (GFE)**. See here: <https://www.thebalancemoney.com/compare-good-faith-estimate-1798461> (emphasis added):

    > The **GFE** has been replaced by the **Loan Estimate**, and the **HUD-1** by the **Closing Disclosure**. If you purchased a home **after October 3, 2015**, you should have received these documents. The new document is very similar to the original.

1. The vast majority of brokers and lenders worth talking to will give you their numbers for interest rate and **P&I** (monthly Principal + Interest payment) _over the phone within 5 minutes_ of talking to them. 
    1. If they are stalling or screwing around with you, politely call them out on it. You may ask to speak to a manager or different loan officer if you'd like to try someone else at the company. _Not all people do their jobs equally well._
    1. Do not ask for an LE from *everyone* if their numbers just aren't good, but if their numbers _are_ competitive, ask them for one. If you verbally request it, the good ones will give you a *written*, emailed LE within 1 day of talking to them, even with*out* a full application with them. If one of them says otherwise, remind them over the phone that most good ones will, and point them to this article. I've spoken to probably **75** or so lenders, and found this to be the case.
    1. If your lender refuses to give you a written LE until you formally apply, *and* refuses to give you a verbal, estimated interest rate and P&I for your requested loan amount, then _they aren't worth talking to._ Get off the phone and quit wasting your time with them! But, if they _have_ given you _competitive numbers_ and only refuse to give you a _written LE_ until you formally apply, then feel free to apply, _so long as you've verified their email address and NMLS number already--see above!_ From <https://www.thebalancemoney.com/compare-good-faith-estimate-1798461> (emphasis added): 

    > Lenders are required to issue the loan estimate **within three days of a home loan application**. If a loan originator does not provide a loan estimate within three business days of receiving a completed loan application, that lender is in **violation of current regulations**.

1. You do _not_ have to use a local lender or broker! The company that might give you the best deal for your Idaho or Arizona or Virginia loan, for instance, might be in California or Utah or wherever. So, look across multiple brokers and lenders online or elsewhere. When you call, simply tell them which state your are in and ask them if they are legally authorized to do business in that state. 

1. _Compete_ your lenders against each other to get them to give you the best deal!
    1. Oddly enough, this is actually a core part of their business, and they are very accustomed to competing for your business. This is a common practice. Just be open and honest with them and don't let them jerk you around. Stand your ground. Here is a basic strategy: 
        1. Talk to 5 to 6 lenders, including *at least* 2 who are *brokers*, since brokers can _frequently_ compete the best, _by far_, and frequently have the most leeway to compete! (At a large lender, the consumer-facing loan officers are limited by loads of bureaucracy and company policies. At a smaller brokerage firm, however, the brokers can frequently decrease their commission to sweeten the deal for you if they really want your business). 
        1. Choose your best 3 LEs/companies, and try to negotiate with them over the phone to get them to beat the others. Ex: call the 2nd best company and say, "company 1 offered me x interest rate with zero buy-down points and no origination fee." I know you said you can do y, but since they are offering x, can you beat it?" They may offer a better deal, or they may say they can't compete unless the other LE is "locked". If they improve their verbal deal, repeat this step, calling the new 2nd best company and asking if they'll beat it. Once your top 3 have said they need a locked LE to compete further, proceed to the next step.  
        1. "Lock" the Loan Estimate (LE) with the best *one* company, and take that _locked_ LE to the other *two* companies. See if any will "compete" with this locked LE and beat it. If they will, ask them to _lock_ their competing estimate. If they won't or can't offer something better, or if they verbally offer something better but refuse to lock their better deal by producing a locked LE themselves, tell them they are self-eliminating, and then remove them from your list. You need the "winner" here to both *beat* all other deals, *and* write it down into a *locked* LE. Once they lock their competing LE, take it back to the first company who locked, and ask that first company to beat the new best locked LE. If they say they can't beat it, or if they say they refuse to lock a new estimate, inform them they are self-eliminating, and then remove them. If the first company who "locked" does compete against the new locked LE and beats it again, ask them to lock it. Take it back to company 2 who beat the first locked LE from company 1, and ask company 2 if they can beat this new locked LE from company 1. Repeat this process until you have a winner among the top 3 best LEs. Be _open and honest_ throughout this process. After you get your first locked LE with the original best deal, it's okay to tell them you are going to compete that offer. When you talk to the other top 2 companies, ask them to compete. If it comes up, don't hide it that you're going to compete until everyone self-eliminates and a single "winner" emerges. You don't necessarily need to advertise it to them like this, but you don't have to hide this fact either. 
    1. Real-life example: on a VA loan refinance in Dec. 2020, I used the above technique to get a killer good deal. One company was offering 2.25% interest rate with a closing cost (_excluding_ Prepaids--section F, and Escrow--section G) of **$13000**. That wasn't a good deal on costs. They had a $7200 origination fee. A more-typical competitive offer was 2.25% interest rate with a closing cost of **$7500**. I contacted a broker and got that down to **$3000**, which was amazing! I was still probing, so I let them just make their best offer rather than telling them what my current best was. Once they did that, I used that as a baseline. I locked the LE and then did the competition strategy above, reaching out to another broker. After a few rounds of back-and-forth between the two brokers, my total closing costs ended up being about **negative $1500**, meaning I was **making money** *instantly* on the refinance! And no, I do *not* mean I took "cash out" and raised the loan amount. I mean, the loan amount stayed exactly constant, and the interest rate was 2.25%, and the loan origination fee was $0 with zero buy-down points, and on top of all of that I got **$1850 in _lender credits_**. So, once I got back the old loan's escrow, I was able to use it to fund the new loan's escrow, and was then still left over with $1500 extra back in our pocket, due to the lender credits which covered part of the escrow. The all-up cost of our refinance was **negative $1500**. The LEs I got ranged from this **-$1500** cost to up to **$20000** cost, with a more-typical number being around **$7000**. Shopping around and competing LEs can save you **tens of thousands of dollars**!

1. You may want to pay a little extra, rather than competing for days or weeks. 
    1. If you're in a rush to close (ex: due to building a new house and needing the lender to move quickly once it's done), and/or have major time constraints on moving out of your current place of dwelling and into your new house, or if you are under a lot of pressure at work, _paying a couple thousand extra dollars in origination fees_ to a **local or higher-quality lender** over an **online or inexpensive broker** _can_ be worth it. Consider it. Maybe getting from the **+$20000** total cost LE to the **+$7000** total cost LE is 5 hours of work, and is 100% worth it, but getting from **+$7000** to **+$3500** is another 5 hours of work, and less worth it. Then, calling more brokers and competing from **+$3500** to **-$1500** is another 5 to 10 hours of work. As your costs get lower, you get diminishing returns. At some point, depending on your life pressures and overall stress level, the returns become less worth-it. Have an idea up-front of _when_ you will decide to call it quits and take what you've got--that penny-pinching and calling around for days just isn't worth it. Consider calling *at least* a few lenders--never just 1 or 2, but you don't need to talk to dozens, and if you are happy after a single round of locked-LE-competing, feel free to just be done. Save your time and sanity and go play with your kids, build an RC airplane, write an app, or 3D print something. 

That's the bulk of my tips for now.
