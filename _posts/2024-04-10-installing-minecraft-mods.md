_Tested in Linux Ubuntu 22.04._


## Option 1: The manual method

1. Find a mod you want, such as "Dragon Survival [Forge]" on CurseForce.com, here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dragons-survival

1. Click the "Download" button, as shown below:

        </a>
    </p>

1. Click the "All Game Versions" dropdown menu and select the version of Minecraft you want to install the mod into. If not sure, just choose the latest version available, which is `1.20.1` for this mod and at the time of this writing.
1. Click the "All Mod Loaders" dropdown menu and select "Forge". Then, click "Download File", as shown below:

        </a>
    </p>

1. Save the `DragonSurvival-1.20.1-09.01.2024.jar` Java .jar mod file into the location of your choosing. I like to save mods into a directory at `~/Downloads/Install_Files/Minecraft/mods/`.

1. Download and install the version of Minecraft Forge that corresponds to your mod version you downloaded above. In my case, I need Minecraft Forge 1.20.1. 

    1. Go here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/ --> click `1.20.1` in the left-hand pane --> under "Download Latest", click "Installer". 

        _Note: I generally like to use the "Download Latest" version. If I have any problems with it, however, then I will try the "Download Recommended" version instead._
