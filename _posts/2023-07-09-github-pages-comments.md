This, <https://gabrielstaples.com/>, is my [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) static website and blog, powered by the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, based on a custom-modified version of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/), and written in the efficient, fast, and easy-to-read markup language called [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

This website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and configured with my custom domain. 

I've added GitHub-Issue-based comments to the bottom of this website using the plugin called [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), which is totally awesome and makes it trivial to add a beautiful and user-friendly commenting system to your static website or blog.

Scroll to the bottom and leave a comment if you like. _No spam or swearing._ I moderate everything.
