Let's imagine you're a **buyer** and you have a VA loan on a property. You move and rent out your house. You want to know: 
1. **"Can I buy a 2nd property (which will now be my primary house I live in) with a 2nd VA loan?"** 
1. "Do I have any "VA entitlement" remaining?"

Use my calculator below to find out.

Let's imagine you're a **lender** or **loan officer** and a veteran asks you if they can use their VA loan on a 2nd loan for a house which they'd like to finance through you. 

Use my calculator below to help them find out.

    1. I called the number above on 5 Apr. 2022 and discussed my calculator here with them live for 45 minutes to ensure I got my calculations right. We both agreed the calculator was right. You can always call them youself to be sure.

    1. Use my calculator instead. If you aren't even eligible for a VA loan on a 2nd home because your existing VA loan is already too much, my calculator will tell you that. Theirs won't. 
    1. In the case you *are* eligible for a 2nd VA loan, you can compare my results to theirs. My results are more granular.
