Ideated: 15 Nov. 2020 

Talk about this article regarding Kamala's view on legalizing sex work, as well as Oregon's decriminalization of hard drugs. https://www.facebook.com/gabriel.staples1/posts/10100849189469543. Post my responses and views on it, as a type of discussion. Emphasize compassion, and creating laws which promote repentance and are Godly (ex: putting drug addicts in rehab instead of in prison), rather than which focus on life-long criminalization and punishment. Find compassion and common ground with Kamala, and encourage her to change her viewpoint on the legalization of sex work, as that's not the right way to handle the problem of people being abused who are engaging in it (do research first--I'm assuming this is likely why she sees what she sees and has the viewpoint she has). Seek to understand her viewpoint and why she wants to legalize sex work.
